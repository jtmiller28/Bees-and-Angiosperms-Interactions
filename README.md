# Bees and Angiosperm interactions

My research oriented repository for exploring bee & flowering plant co-occurrences, interactions, and relational biodiversity. 

_Research Question(s):_ 
What drives bee diversity in California? How can we link flowering plant & bee diversity using open source occurrence data? What trends in the level 3 ecoregions of California shape these two groups assemblages?
